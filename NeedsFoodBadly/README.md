# NeedsFoodBadly

NeedsFoodBadly is a simple food manager inspired by Buffet. You want to eat food, not spend time 
figuring out what you have left in your bag.

NeedsFoodBadly creates two macros that you can add to your action bar.

NFB_Food lets you eat food, or buff food if you are holding a the Ctrl button. It will choose the
best food you have, prioritizing food that you have less of. Conjured food will always be considered the best.

If you are in combat, NFB_Food will switch to showing you Potions, or a Healthstone if you hold Ctrl.

In or out of combat, you can hold shift to use bandages.

NFB_Drink similarly lets you drink the best mana restoration drink you have (or potion if you are in combat).
